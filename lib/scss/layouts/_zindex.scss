/*
 * Control the order of z-index elements
 *
 * Here you define the list of elements to order, from bottom to top
 * The position in the list will determine the z-index value.
 * You could have several lists if you have more than one context.
 *
 * To use it you just call the z() function (defined in /helpers/_functions.scss)
 * to assign an index to the element, e.g.:
 * 
 *	.input-field {
 *		z-index: z($elements, user-tooltip);
 *	}
