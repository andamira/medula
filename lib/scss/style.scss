/**
 * 4 /MODULES
 *
 * This directory also contains only partials and is reserved for reusable UI patterns.
 * As a general rule of thumb, anytime you anticipate needing the same CSS more than once,
 * you should modularize it. The more your project matures, the more CSS you should be able
 * to compartmentalize into modules. Preferably, each module contains a mixin at the top
 * with corresponding declarations at the bottom for including that mixin. Crafting your
 * modules in this fashion helps you start thinking about CSS in a more modular way.
 * They are also easier to expand upon and/or extend in the future.
