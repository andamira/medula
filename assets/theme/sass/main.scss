/// 3 /MODULES
///
/// This directory contains partials and placeholders, and is reserved for reusable UI patterns.
///
/// As a general rule of thumb, anytime you anticipate needing the same CSS more than once,
/// you should modularize it. The more your project matures, the more CSS you should be able
/// to compartmentalize into modules. Preferably, each module contains a mixin at the top
/// with corresponding declarations at the bottom for including that mixin.
///
/// Crafting your modules in this fashion helps you start thinking about CSS in a more
/// modular way. They are also easier to expand upon and/or extend in the future.
