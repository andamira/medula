* Advanced Functionality
  Ósea comes with a stater plugin in /lib/plugin/ where you can write all the functionality that [doesn't really belong in the theme](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/09/14/why-custom-post-types-belong-in-plugins) like Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Shortcodes, Analytics, etc. You can either enable it from the functions.php file or you can move the folder to the plugins folder and turn it into a standalone plugin.

## History

It started as a fork of [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) v1.7. It also got some ideas and inspiration from [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-WordPress-Theme), [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank), [SMACSS & Sass WP](https://github.com/websanya/smacss-sass-wp) and [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).

It depends on [Compass](http://compass-style.org), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) and [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/). It also includes [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/). Supports all modern browsers and also IE8 (for now).
