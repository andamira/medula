A mobile-first, HTML5 starter theme for WordPress, focused in clarity, modularity and versatility.

Ósea means _from the nature of the bone_ in spanish, and it is pronounced [ 'o se a ].  

It has been inspired by the following projects and incorporates some of their code and ideas:
* [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones)
* [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-WordPress-Theme)
* [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank)
* [SMACSS & Sass WP](https://github.com/websanya/smacss-sass-wp)

Ósea uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styling, and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) for the grid system.


_Warning: This project is still going through pretty big structural changes._
