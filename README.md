A mobile-first starter theme for WordPress.

Ósea is full HTML5 and CSS3. It uses [Compass](http://compass-style.org) >= 1.0, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) >= 3.3, and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) >= 2.1

It is focused in cleanliness, modularity, and versatility.

It has been inspired by the following projects and incorporates some of their code and ideas:
* [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones)
* [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-WordPress-Theme)
* [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank)
* [SMACSS & Sass WP](https://github.com/websanya/smacss-sass-wp)



_Warning: This project is still going through pretty big structural changes._
