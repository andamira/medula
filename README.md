A mobile-first, simple and clean but also versatile and powerful starter theme for Wordpress.

Ósea means _from the nature of the bone_ in spanish, and it is pronounced [ 'o se a ].  
Originally inspired by [bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones), uses some of its code.

HTML5 templates, styling with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) grid system.

_PS: This project is still young, and it is going to be a little mess for a while._
