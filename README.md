**A modern & clean mobile-first starter theme for WordPress.**

It's key points are:

1. Good design decisions, so it is modular and maintainable.
1. Mobile First, so it is progressively enhanced.
1. Simplicity, so that its structure can be easily grasped on.
1. Versatility, so that it can be used for any kind of project.

Ósea is commited to semantic HTML5 markup and CSS3. It makes use [Compass](http://compass-style.org) >= 1.0, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) >= 3.3, and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) >= 2.1. Includes [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) and [HTML5 Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv)


It has been mostly inspired by [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) and in a lesser extent by [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-WordPress-Theme), [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank) & [SMACSS & Sass WP](https://github.com/websanya/smacss-sass-wp)



_Warning: This project is still going through pretty big structural changes._
