**A Mobile First Starter Theme for WordPress**

Ósea is commited to semantic HTML5 markup and CSS3. It has many features and focuses in finding the sweet spot between minimallism and versatility.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the git repo or [download it](https://github.com/andamira/osea/archive/master.zip).

  `git clone https://github.com/andamira/osea.git`

2. Install the dependencies

  `gem install compass sass susy breakpoint --no-ri --no-rdoc`

3. Place it in theme folder, activate it from WordPress, and start developing like there's no tomorrow.

4. You can run `compass-watch.sh` script from `/lib/scss/` folder so it automatically monitor changes & updates the css files.

## Features & Key Points

* Starter Theme

  Ósea is not designed to be a parent theme, nor a framework. It is designed to be a clean starting point to modify for each project, developing over it.

* Simplicity & Minimalism

  Everything has a purpose and its own place. An big effort has been made in making it simple to be fully understood, as well as remaining very powerful.

* Modularity and Maintainability.

  DRY principles. Clear documentation. Index present in all files. Follows the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).

* Mobile First

  Lightweight, Progressively Enhanced, Powerful Grid System.

* Advanced Functionality

  Ósea comes with a stater plugin in /lib/plugin/ where you can write all the functionality that [doesn't really belong in the theme](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/09/14/why-custom-post-types-belong-in-plugins) like Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Shortcodes, Analytics, etc. You can either enable it from the functions.php file or you can move the folder to the plugins folder and turn it into a standalone plugin.

## History

It started as a fork of [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) v1.7. It also got some ideas and inspiration from [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-WordPress-Theme), [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank), [SMACSS & Sass WP](https://github.com/websanya/smacss-sass-wp) and [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).

It depends on [Compass](http://compass-style.org), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) and [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/). It also includes [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/). Supports all modern browsers and also IE8 (for now).
