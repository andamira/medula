Its key points are:

1. Simplicity, modularity and maintainability.
1. Mobile First, light, progressively enhanced.
1. Versatility, it can be used for any project.
1. Accesibility, makes use of compatibility standards.

Ósea is commited to semantic HTML5 markup and CSS3. It depends on [Compass](http://compass-style.org), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) and [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/). Includes [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/). Supports all modern browsers and also IE8 (for now).


It started as a fork of [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) v1.7. It also got some ideas and inspiraton from [HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-WordPress-Theme), [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank), [SMACSS & Sass WP](https://github.com/websanya/smacss-sass-wp) and [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).


_Warning: This project is still going through pretty big structural changes._
